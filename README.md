# Pokedex

Pokedex it's a artificial intelligence that has as goal recognizing some pokemons images.

> This is a project that was developed for InteligÃªncia Artificial course from UFCG

---

## Usage

- The model produced can recognize among seven pokemons, which are: pikachu, charmander, squirtle, bulbasaur, cyndaquil, totodile and chikorita.
- The searchimages package has some scripts that can be used for collecting images for the dataset.
- Since the trained model is to big for a commit , it will be find on google drive.
- [Trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DA2EeCIO4FF8kHjEIJm82oFO_K7hvA-r/view?usp=sharing)

> To classify images
```shell
$ python3 classifier.py --model path_to_pokedex.model --labelbin lb.pickle --image examples/pikachu1.jpeg
```

> To train a new model
```shell
$ python3 train.py --dataset path_to_dataset --model path_to_pokedex.model --labelbin lb.pickle
```

> For more details about the arguments
